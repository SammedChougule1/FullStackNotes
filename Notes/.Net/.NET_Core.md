- Global.json - You can define the solution level settings in global.json file for example your application name and version.
- Launchsettings.json – You can set the environment variables in this file. For example, set development or production environment in this file.
- Appsettings.json – Configuration settings like database connection string can 
be set in this file. Similar to web.config in ASP.NET.
- Project.json - ASP.NET Core uses Project.JSON file for storing all project level configuration settings. For example the nugget packages you have installed in the project

## filters
custom class where you can write custom logic to execute before or after an action method executes.
```C#
[autherize(Role = "Admin")]
public ActionResult somefunction()
```
| Filter Type           | Description                                                                                     | Built-in Filter                 | Interface              |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------|
| Authorization filters | Performs authentication and authorizes before executing an action method.                       | [Authorize], [RequireHttps]     | IAuthorizationFilter   |
| Action filters        | Performs some custom operation before and after an action method executes.                      |                                 | IActionFilter          |
| Result filters        | Performs some operation before or after the execution of the view. For example, to modify a view result right before the view is rendered to the browser. | [OutputCache]                   | IResultFilter          |
| Exception filters     | Performs some operation if there is an unhandled exception thrown during the execution of the ASP.NET MVC pipeline. | [HandleError]                   | IExceptionFilter       |


## return types of ACTION method in MVC
1. VIEWRESULT - This return type is used to return a webpage from an action method.
2. PARTIALVIEWRESULT - This return type is used to send a part of a view that will be rendered in another view.
3. REDIRECTRESULT - This return type is used to redirect to any other controller and action method depending on the URL.
4. REDIRECTTOROUTERESULT - This return type is used when we want to redirect to any other action method.
5. CONTENTRESULT - This return type is used to return HTTP content type like text/plain as the result of the action.
6. JSONRESULT - This return type is used when we want to return a JSON message.
7. JAVASCRIPTRESULT - This return type is used to return JavaScript code that will run in the browser.
8. FILERESULT - This return type is used to send binary output in response.
9. EMPTYRESULT - This return type is used to return nothing (void) in the result.

### Token structure
- Header :    
    - Signing algorithm
    - the type of the token
     ```JSON 
        {
        //Base64Url encoded 
        "alg": "HS256", // HMAC SHA256 or RSA etc.
        "typ": "JWT"
        }
    ```
- Payload(Claims) : 
    - Claims : 
        
        Claims are statements about an entity (typically, the user) and additional data.
        - Registered claims : set of predefined claims which are not mandatory but recommended
            - iss (Issuer): Identifies the principal that issued the token.
            - sub (Subject): Identifies the principal that is the subject of the token.
            - aud (Audience): Identifies the recipients that the token is intended for.
            - exp (Expiration Time): The time after which the token expires.
            - nbf (Not Before): The time before which the token must not be accepted.
            - iat (Issued At): The time at which the token was issued.
            - jti (JWT ID): A unique identifier for the token.
        - Public claims : 
        
            These are custom claims that can be defined by anyone and should be collision-resistant. It is advisable to define these claims in the IANA JSON Web Token Registry or use namespaced claims to avoid conflicts.
        - Private claims : 

            These are custom claims created to share information between parties that agree on them. They are neither registered nor public claims.

            ```JSON
            {
              "sub": "1234567890",
              "name": "John Doe",
              "iat": 1516239022
            }

            ```
- Signature :

    To create the signature part, you need to have the encoded header, encoded payload, and a secret key (for HMAC algorithms) or a private key (for RSA or ECDSA algorithms). The process is as follows:

    - Encode the header and payload using Base64Url encoding.
    - Concatenate the encoded header and payload with a period (.).
    - Use the signing algorithm and the secret or private key to sign this string.
    - Syntax :
    ```C#
    //Encrypt is encryption function which encrypts the message with secret Key
    var signature = Encrypt(Hash(header+"."+payload));
    var secret = signature;
    // HMACSHA256 is encryption algo
    var jwt =  HMACSHA256(header+"."+payload+"."+secret);
    ```
    ```JSON
    HMACSHA256(
        base64UrlEncode(header) + "." +
        base64UrlEncode(payload),
        secret)

    ```
    - Eample : 
    ```JSON
    HMACSHA256(
        base64UrlEncode(header) + "." +
        base64UrlEncode(payload),
        "your-256-bit-secret")

    ```
- JWT token : 
``` Header.Payload.Signature ```
- Example : 
    ```JSON
     eyJhbGciOiAiSFMyNTYiLCAidHlwIjogIkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiAiMTIzNDU2Nzg5MCIsICJuYW1lIjogIkpvaG4gRG9lIiwgImlhdCI6IDE1MTYyMzkwMjJ9.lmFmoaR6p0bXN8rRH9Rbb14s7gD7URKwqVq2NTjsF1I
    ```
